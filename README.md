# Pomodoro-App
## The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, which involves breaking down work into 25-minute intervals (called "Pomodoros"), separated by short breaks.
### The objective of a Pomodoro timer application is to help individuals manage their time and improve their productivity.
A Pomodoro timer application typically allows users to set a timer for their work sessions and breaks, and alerts them when it's time to switch between the two. It includes additional features like task lists and flash cards, to help user recall and revise the things they learnt in that time frame.
The benefits of using a Pomodoro timer application include increased focus and concentration, better time management, reduced procrastination, and improved work-life balance. By breaking work into manageable chunks and taking regular breaks, individuals can maintain their productivity over extended periods and avoid burnout.
